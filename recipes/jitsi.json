# Since this is never going to work as a json file for kujenga, I'm adding some notes here
# I used godaddy to set up the DNS entry for anseri.com to point to a EC2 elastic IP address. 
# The EC2 instance needs to have that  elastic IP attached to it.  I used godaddy to set up the
# DNS entry to point to that specific elastic IP, so if that changes, the DNS entry at godaddy
# needs to change as well
